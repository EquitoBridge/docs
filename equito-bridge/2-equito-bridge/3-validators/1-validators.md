## Validators

The Equito Node Validator is a software application that operates on multiple instances of nodes. These instances are interconnected through a shared database. Each validator has accounts set up for each of the blockchain networks that are being used. These accounts are stored in a secure vault. The validators have an internal scheduler that periodically performs various tasks, such as creating and signing release transactions, and executing signed transactions. If any of these tasks fail, the validator logs the error and moves on to the next task in the queue. All validators are connected to smart contracts on the configured blockchain networks, which process multi-signature release requests. Each validator represents a unit in the multi-signature process, which is only accepted by the network if the specified number of validators have signed the requested transaction.
