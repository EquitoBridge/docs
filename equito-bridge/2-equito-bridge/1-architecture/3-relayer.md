### Bridge Relayer

The Equito Finance Bridge Relayer is a protocol that will act as a bridge relay across supported chains, enabling the passing of validation messages and requests through the bridge smart contract.

The Bridge Relayer provides decentralized messaging protocols for bridge operations across all supported chains. The Bridge Relayer on IBC protocol will help create messages to be relayed from one ledger to another by monitoring “relayer processes”. These relayers continuously scan the state of ledgers that implement the IBC protocol and relay packets when these packets are present.

This allows for the execution of transactions on connected ledgers once outgoing packets have been committed through relaying. The Equito Bridge Protocol implements lock and release and the standard mint and burn bridging mechanism, which are communicated across the bridge networks using the Bridge Relayer.

The Equito Bridge Decentralized Protocol offers several benefits, including decentralized bridge operations and validation, decentralized Equito bridge messaging services to increase reliability and security, and the creation of an immutable record of all bridge transactions to increase transparency.

The use of the relay chain protocol marks the beginning of the full decentralization of the Equito Bridge. Equito Finance seeks to be as transparent and decentralized as possible. Through the Bridge Relayer, Equito Finance is taking a step further in its decentralized approach.
