# Introduction

## What is Equito Bridge?

Equito bridge is a technical protocol that allows the transfer of digital assets between different blockchain networks. Our bridge is essential for the interoperability of various blockchain networks, which enables seamless and efficient transactions of digital assets across different blockchain networks.

## How does it work?

Equito bridge involves two distinct blockchain networks, where one is the source blockchain, and the other is the destination blockchain. The source blockchain is the blockchain network that holds the assets that are to be transferred, while the destination blockchain is the blockchain network that will receive the assets. The bridge connects these two blockchain networks to facilitate the transfer of assets.

## General step

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how our bridge works to transfer assets between two different blockchains:

1. Locking the assets: The first step in transferring assets between two blockchains is to lock the assets on the original blockchain. This involves sending the assets to a smart contract on the original blockchain. The smart contract will hold the assets until the transfer is complete.

2. Wait for confirmation: After the assets have been locked, the bridge waits for confirmation that the transfer has been completed. This typically involves waiting for a certain number of blocks to be added to the original blockchain.

3. Minting new assets: Once the transfer is complete and the assets have been verified and validated on the destination blockchain, the blockchain bridge will typically mint new assets on the destination blockchain. These new assets will be equivalent to the assets that were locked on the original blockchain.

4. Use new assets: Once the new assets have been minted, the user can use them on the destination blockchain just like any other asset.
